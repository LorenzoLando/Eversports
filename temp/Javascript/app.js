 let aboutText = `It all started in Vienna, Austria, back in 2013: Our founder and CEO, Hanno Lippitsch, was a national volleyball player who wanted to play tennis. While browsing the net searching for tennis courts, Hanno realised how difficult it was to book a location and a time slot.
 In the era of digitalisation where people book and pay for flights, taxis or hotels within a few mouse clicks, the sports industry was still lacking an online solution to manage its business and ease its clientsâ€™ lives
So Hanno set his goal to provide professionals and business owners with a modern software tool to manage and run their business. And on the same hand we also want to offer sport lovers a great way to book their activities anywhere, anytime, from their phone, tablet or computer.
Today Eversports provides its management software to more than 2500 business owners in 8 different countries. Whether you run a yoga studio, gym or a tennis club, Eversports gives you the best tools to manage your business in a smart way and brings your marketing strategy to the next level in a digitalised world.`;
